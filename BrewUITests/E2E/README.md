# Live end-to-end canaries (Tier 3)

A small suite that runs the app with **production wiring** against **real Homebrew** and the **real
network**. Everything else in `BrewUITests` stubs the two process boundaries and is deterministic;
this does not.

Run it with `scripts/test-e2e` (test plan `Brew-E2E`). It runs on every pull request as its own job,
separate from the deterministic suite: `scripts/test-ui` (test plan `Brew-UI`) skips these tests by
name, so a live failure never reads as a failure of the fixture-backed suite.

## What it is for

A **contract canary**. If Homebrew changes its JSON shape or CLI output and breaks a feature's happy
path, this suite goes red while the deterministic Tier 2 suite — which is answering from fixtures —
stays green. It is not here to broaden coverage; it is here to notice when the fixtures have started
lying.

Covered: install · uninstall · config · search · navigation · console.

Not covered, on purpose:

- **upgrade** — needs a deterministically outdated installed package, which a live machine cannot be
  guaranteed to have without brittle bottle pinning.
- **doctor** — output is entirely machine-state dependent, so there is no stable happy path.
- **error cases** — all of them belong at Tier 2, where a failure is a fixture rather than an outage.

## It mutates this machine

`InstallUninstallE2ETests` **installs and uninstalls the formula `hello`** (GNU Hello: no
dependencies, pours in seconds). It force-uninstalls it before and after every test, so a run leaves
no residue even if it fails part way.

**`hello` is owned by this suite.** Nothing — no fixture, no other test, no developer setup — may
depend on it being installed. If you need a canary package for something else, pick a different one
and document it here.

Ephemeral CI runners are the intended home for this. On a developer machine it is safe but not
invisible: it will uninstall a `hello` you installed yourself.

## Assertions are shape, not values

Versions, dependency counts and `brew config` values drift constantly, and a canary that fails on a
version bump gets muted within a week. So:

| Flow | What is asserted |
| --- | --- |
| Search | a result row for the package *exists* (catalogue fetched and decoded) |
| Config | a `HOMEBREW_VERSION` / `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` row is *present* (`brew config` still parses) |
| Install / uninstall | presence/absence *transitions*, console streamed non-empty output ending in success |
| Navigation | each screen root loads with real data behind it |

## How state isolation works

Responsibilities are split: **arrange and clean up by shelling out to real brew** (`Brew.run` /
`Brew.forceUninstall`, a `Process` helper that is a fixture actuator and never the code under test);
**act through the app's UI** using the same page objects the stubbed suite uses. A broken arrange then
reads as a fixture failure rather than as a red assertion inside the flow under test.

The app ignores inherited Homebrew variables. [CI](../../.github/workflows/e2e.yml) writes the
fixture settings to `~/.homebrew/brew.env`. For equivalent manual runs, merge those settings into
your configuration and restore it afterwards. The test harness does not edit your configuration.

## Requirements

- Homebrew installed (`/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` or `/usr/local/bin/brew`) — the suite fails by name in
  `setUp` if it is missing rather than failing slowly on a missing element.
- Network egress to `formulae.brew.sh` and `ghcr.io`.
- The same Accessibility/Automation permissions the deterministic UI suite needs — see
  `../TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

## When it runs

- **On every pull request** via `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`, plus manual dispatch.
- **Before cutting a release**, by hand: `scripts/test-e2e`. That is the moment you most want to know
  brew has not shifted under the app. The release workflow itself is deliberately not wired to it.

The plan runs serially with generous per-test timeouts and retries a failing test twice (three runs
in all), which absorbs a transient network blip.

## When a retry hides something

A retry that turns red into green is exactly how a real contract break gets mistaken for weather, so
a passing run says when it needed one. `scripts/annotate-flaky-tests` reads the result bundle after
every run and names any test that took more than one run to pass — as a `::warning::` annotation on
the GitHub run, and as plain text locally. It never fails a run by itself.

The evidence lives in the result bundle: `BrewUITestCase.record(_:)` attaches a screenshot of the
whole screen to every failure. Both it and the plan use the `keepAlways` lifetime, because the
interesting screenshot belongs to a failed *attempt* of a test that ultimately passed, and
`deleteOnSuccess` prunes exactly that. The job uploads the bundle when the run fails **and**
when a test only passed on a retry, so that screenshot is not thrown away with the green run.
